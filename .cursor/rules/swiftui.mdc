# SwiftUI rules

- Use structs for views and keep them small and focused
- Use @State for simple view-local state
- Use @ObservableObject with @Published for shared state
- Use @Binding to pass mutable state to child views
- Create custom ViewModifiers for reusable styling
- Use environment objects for dependency injection
- Use LazyVStack and LazyHStack for large collections
- Extract complex view logic into separate components
